# Gallery Downloader
Download all the attachments of a given gallery.

Fun little project I decided to tackle to learn The Go Programming Language. Will try to add more stuff as I keep learning.

## Usage

 ```console
$ go build downloader.go
$ ./downloader -b [board] -n [thread number]
```

Work in progress. First goal is to download attachments from imageboard threads. Will be testing with that certain four leaf website. In the future I'd like to add the possibility to download galleries from other websites.
